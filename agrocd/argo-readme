 How it works (Flow):
You write YAML files for your frontend, backend (Deployment, Service, Ingress, etc.).

Push those YAMLs to a GitHub repo.

ArgoCD watches that repo continuously.

Whenever it sees a change (new image, updated replica count, etc):

ArgoCD pulls the changes

Applies them automatically to your EKS Cluster

Result: Your EKS cluster is always synced with your Git repository â€” NO MANUAL kubectl apply needed!
